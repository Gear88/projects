    <h1>My First Webpage Folowing the Odin Circulum</h1>

    <h6>Heading 6</h6>

    <p>
      I am making a paragraph about the various uses of html tags for text markup. This as using the "P" tag.
      All paragraps are made using the same tag. As you can see there are also a lot of heading tags. There are 
      only 6 thouh so dont try to use any others. They dont exist. If I want to make a comment on the webpage 
      I should use a less then symbol followed by !-- and close it off with two dashes and a greater than symbol.
    </p>
    <!--This is a comment it wont show up in the page.--> 
    <p>
      There are <em>other</em> tags that are also <strong>very</strong> important for displaying text with html on
      the webpage. They have already been used. The first one is the <em>"em"</em> tag it makes the words closed within 
      italicized. The other is the <strong>"strong"</strong> tag. It makes the words contained within it bold. The 
      coolest thing about these tags is that I can use them both at the same time to make text 
      <em><strong> bold and italicized</strong></em>. I knew a lot of this already because I took an HTML class
      in college but this was a really good refresher on the uses of these tags. This will also give me more practice 
      uploading to my git reposotory. The tags "b" and "i" can also serve similar functions but they only change the 
      text visually. That means screen readers wont add any extra meaning to the words when reading outloud. I wont use 
      so that my projects can be more accessible to everyone. Next i get to pratice with lists.
